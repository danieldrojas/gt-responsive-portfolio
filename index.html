                   <p> My name is Daniel. I was born and raised in
                    Maracaibo, Venezuela. I have 4
                    brothers and a sister. Growing up I practiced swimming,
                    karate and fencing. I graduated from college with a
                    bacherlor's
                    degree in
                    Chemical Engineering from
                    University of Zulia. I was lucky to have been able to attend
                    that school because
                    it is a hard university to enter. After college I
                    joined a Christian campus ministry as staff for a year,
                    which
                    was a very good
                    experience. After that I moved to the United States to my
                    uncles's house.</p> </div>

                <p>Moving to the States has been the biggest challenge I've ever
                    had to take, but
                    it helped me grow and
                    build a broader world view.
                    Learning English has also been challenging
                    but is very satisfying being able to understand how
                    languages shape the
                    culture and people.
                    Also in 2019 I got married and I live happily in an Atlanta
                    suburb.</p>
