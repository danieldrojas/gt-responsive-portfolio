                <p id="main-text">My name is Daniel. I was born and raised in Maracaibo, Venezuela. I have 4 brothers and a sister between my parents. Growing up I practice swimming,  
                    Karate and lastly fancing. I graduated from college with a bacherlor's in Chemical Engineering from
                    University of Zulia. I was looky to had been  able to attend there because is a hard university to get in. After callege I
                    joined a Christian Campuse ministry as campus staff for a year which was a very good experince. After that I moved to the United States, and 
                    I lived with my uncle.

                <p >Moving to the States has been the biggest chanllenge I've ever had to take, but
                has helped my to grow and
                build my own opinions, about work ethic and also to understand other viewpoints.
                Learning English has been also chanlleging but
                but is veery satisfacting being able to understand how languages shape the
                culture or the opposive.
                Also in 2019 I got merried and I live happly in a Atlanta suburb.
