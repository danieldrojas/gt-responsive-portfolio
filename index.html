                <p id="main-text"> My name is Daniel. I was born and raised in
                Maracaibo, Venezuela. I have 4
                brothers and a sister. Growing up I practiced swimming,
                karate and fencing. I graduated from college with a bacherlor's
                degree in
                Chemical Engineering from
                University of Zulia. I was lucky to have been able to attend
                that school because
                it is a hard university to enter. After college I
                joined a Christian campus ministry as staff for a year, which
                was a very good
                experience. After that I moved to the United States to my
                uncles's house. </p>

                <p>Moving to the States has been the biggest challenge I've ever
                    had to take, but
                    it helped me grow and
                    build a broader world view.
                    Learning English has also been challenging
                    but is very satisfying being able to understand how
                    languages shape the
                    culture and people.
                    Also in 2019 I got married and I live happily in an Atlanta
                    suburb.</p>
