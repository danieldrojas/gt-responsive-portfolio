                        <p>Hi! I'm Daniel. I was born and raised in Venezuela where
                            I attended Universidad Del Zulia and graduated with a
                            bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering in 2015. For
                            my senior project, I designed a recovery pilot plant for
                            automotive used oil, for which my team won the support
                            of a Ford dealership to carry on the project. Also, we
                            were selected to be published in Univeridad Del Zulia
                            scientist magazine, "REDILUZ".
                            During my time in college, I was part of multiple
                            student groups, and attended 2 international student
                            conferences in Costa Rica and
                            Argentina. Upon graduation, I joined a Christian campus
                            ministry and worked there until 2016. Afterward, I moved
                            to the United States, and the past year worked as
                            Quality Technician at the ZF plant in Oakwood, GA. </p>

                  <!-- second row text -->
                <div class="row" style="text-justify: auto;">
                    <p>I've always had a natural curiosity for the "why of
                        things" and it excites me to see the process and outcome
                        of solving problems. Now that I've moved to the States,
                        this curiosity has brought me to Software Engineering.
                        So after a long process of validating my credentials, I
                        was accepted in the Fundamentals of Computer Science
                        Graduate Certificate Program at Kennesaw State
                        University. Once I've finished the certificate program,
                        I will be qualified to apply to the Computer Science
                        master degree at Kennesaw or any other university. In
                        the meantime, I'm glad to be accepted and have joined
                        the Full Stack Web Development Program at Georgia Tech
                        University for the Summer of 2020 with which I aim to
                        get a step ahead in the workplace while pursuing further
                        education. </p>

                <p>Moving to the States has been the biggest change I've ever
                    gone through, but it made me realize how resilient one can
                    be and gave me a different confidence in myself. Many
                    positives changes have occurred, such as learning a new
                    language, discovering Mexican food, and meeting my beautiful
                    wife. In my free time, I enjoy DIY projects, all kinds of
                    water activities, and recently I've gotten interested in
                    apiculture.
