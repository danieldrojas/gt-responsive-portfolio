                <p>My name is Daniel. I was born and raised in Maracaibo, Venezuela. I have 4 brothers and a sister between my parents. Growing up I practice swimming,  
                    Karate and lastly fancing. I graduated from college with a bacherlor's in Chemical Engineering from
                    University of Zulia. I was looky to had been  able to attend there because is a hard university to get in. After callege I
                    joined a Christian Campuse ministry as campus staff for a year which was a very good experince. After that I moved to the United States, and 
                    I lived with my uncle.  

       
                    Moving to the States has been the biggest chanllenge I've ever had to take, but has helped my to grow and 
                    build my own opinions, about work ethic and also to understand other viewpoints.  Learning English has been also chanlleging but 
                     but is veery satisfacting being able to understand how languages shape the culture or the opposive.
                     Also in 2019 I got merried and I live happly in a Atlanta suburb.

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
                    random text. It has roots
                    in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
                    making it over 2000 years
                    old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                    Hampden-Sydney College in
                    Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur, from a
                    Lmes from a line in section 1.10.32.
